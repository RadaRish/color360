# Color360 — demo site

This repository contains a minimal prototype for the main landing page of Color360
(frontend + a tiny Node.js/Express backend to demo registration/login/demo token).

## What's included
- `index.html` — landing page with "Перейти в приложение", news, about, contacts.
- `assets/` — styles and client JS (simple fetch calls to API).
- `server.js` — minimal backend with endpoints:
  - `POST /api/register` — {name,email,password}
  - `POST /api/login` — {email,password}
  - `POST /api/demo` — returns demo token
  - `GET /api/news` — sample news list
- `package.json` — dependencies

## Run locally
1. Install Node.js (v16+ recommended).
2. Unzip the archive and in the project folder run:
   ```
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Deploy to VPS

For production deployment on a VPS, see [README-DEPLOY.md](README-DEPLOY.md) for detailed instructions in English or [INSTALL-RU.md](INSTALL-RU.md) for instructions in Russian.

For deployment on reg.ru hosting, see [INSTALL-REG-RU.md](INSTALL-REG-RU.md).

This deployment includes:
- Docker configuration for both main site and panorama editor
- Nginx reverse proxy for routing requests
- SSL setup instructions with Let's Encrypt
- Backup and monitoring strategies

## Notes & next steps
- This is a demo / prototype. The backend stores users in memory — for production use a database and secure password hashing.
- The panorama editor application is now integrated locally and accessible at `/pano` route. For production deployment, you can either keep it local or deploy it to a subdomain like `https://pano.color360.online`.
- You can adapt and extend the frontend (React + real auth) or replace backend with your preferred stack.
